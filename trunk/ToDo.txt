Fix image vector drawing/scaling

Import Tag rules--
	Design schema for tag rules. ?--should transcript be a required top level tag?
	
Import TEI--
	Specify tags for which the text should be
	an object in the transcript pane, able to 
	be associated with image regions

?--how to handle auto tagging, esp with preset values?  Maybe a template object
	with t,l,w,h,rgb that gets applied to any image as a region

The DataPane--
	The data pane should be a transcript of all user actions.
	It consists of media fragments, tags (which include transcriptLines), 
	and groupings.  Groupings associate any # of the others and may have 
	a relationship (ORE?).  Grouping may be created after their children exist,
	but upon creating a new group the interface assumes that the user
	wants to add new elements to the group until specified otherwise.
