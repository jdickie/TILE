TILE: Text-Image Linking Environment
====================================

The Text-Image Linking Environment (TILE) is a web-based tool for creating and editing image-based electronic editions and digital archives of humanities texts. More information is available on the [TILE website](http://mith.umd.edu/tile).

TILE API
----
A summary of the most-recent TILE API is included below. [API documentation](http://mith.umd.edu/tile/documentation/tile-api/) is also provided on the TILE website and reflects code shipped in the latest release; the API documented below may change with future commits.

### ADDING HTML

**addToolBarButton**(button {Object})
Attaches a button to the interface, based on the criteria passed. Returns a button object.

**insertTags**(tags {Object array})
Adds tags to the Attach Metadata dialog

**insertMode**(name {String}, callback {Function})
Creates a new Mode named name, or set of plugins that are organized in the interface. Each Mode has a unique name, which is represented by a button at the top of the interface.

**insertModeHTML**(html {String}, section {String}, name {String})
Takes the string of HTML code html and inserts it into the pre-defined section of the interface section, which is part of the Mode object with name *name*.

**insertPlugin**(obj {Object})
Takes the plugin wrapper obj and passes it off to PluginController, which initiates the plugin into the interface.

**insertModeButtons**(html {String}, section {String}, name {String})
Takes the string of HTML code html and inserts it into the pre-defined toolbar section of the interface section, which is part of the Mode object with name *name*.

### INPUT AND OUTPUT

**parseJSON**(file {String} or file {Object})
Completely resets the JSON session for TILE and either performs an AJAX operation to retrieve JSON from the URL passed in String file, or loads data from an Object

**insertData**(data {Object})
Takes data and parses it into the TILE JSON session.

**getJSON**(page {Boolean})
Gives a deep copy of the core JSON structure that has all current data.

**getXML**(opt {Boolean})
Gives a deepcopy of the JSON, but in XML format

### LINKING DATA

**linkWithActiveObj**(obj1 {Object})
Takes the passed object (see format below) and either attaches it to the active object in PluginController, or if no active object is set, does nothing.

**linkObjects**(obj1 {Object}, obj2 {Object})
Link passed objects together. Neither is set to the active object in PluginController. Each will be added to the JSON if either or both are not already included.

### EDITING DATA

**setActiveObj**(obj {Object})
Sets a particular object as an active object in PluginController.

**attachMetadataDialog**(obj {Object}, handle {String})
Places the Metadata Dialog near the area specified by handle and sets the passed obj as the item to add metadata to.

**deleteObj**(obj {Object})
Deletes an item or reference from the JSON session

### PAGE CHANGING

**nextPage**()
Progresses the TILE JSON pointer to the next page URL and calls the newPage event

**prevPage**()
Takes the TILE JSON pointer to the previous page URL and calls the newPage event

**changePage**(val {Integer})
Changes to the Nth position in the URL stack â€“ based on what value the integer passed is (Does not accept negative integers or integers that go beyond the array of pages)
